<p><strong>Okay, real talk: multiple small avalanches release in juneau after city issues evacuation advisory - ktoo. And I'm supposed to act like this is normal?</strong></p><p>Some of you look confused. Don't worry, I'm confused too. We're all confused. Welcome to the club.</p><p>Political figures rushed to make statements. Both sides. Saying opposite things. As usual. It's like watching a tennis match of terrible takes.</p><p>Social media had a meltdown, naturally. Because that's what we do now. Something happens, we panic-tweet. It's very productive.</p><p>Witnesses described it as 'shocking.' Which is code for 'we literally can't believe we have to report on this.'</p><p>They released a statement. A whole statement! Full of words that said absolutely nothing. It's an art form, really.</p><p>They say it 'raises important questions.' The only question I have is: why am I still talking about this?</p><p>Insiders claim they 'always knew.' Congrats on your hindsight, insiders. Super impressive.</p><p>But seriously, think about it: multiple small avalanches release in juneau after city issues evacuation advisory - ktoo. That's the world we're living in. Let that sink in.</p><p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what passes for news these days. You're welcome for that migraine.</p>
