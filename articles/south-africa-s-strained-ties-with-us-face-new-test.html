<p><strong>Can we talk about this for a second? south africa's strained ties with us face new test - war games with china, iran and russia - bbc. I mean, who comes up with this stuff?</strong></p><p>I can see some of you nodding. Yeah, you get it. You've seen the madness too.</p><p>Sources say they're 'monitoring the situation.' Translation: we have no idea what's happening but we're watching it happen.</p><p>And of course, the 'experts' weighed in. You know, those people who are experts in having opinions about everything. Real helpful, guys.</p><p>Witnesses described it as 'shocking.' Which is code for 'we literally can't believe we have to report on this.'</p><p>They released a statement. A whole statement! Full of words that said absolutely nothing. It's an art form, really.</p><p>Experts predict this will have 'far-reaching implications.' Yeah, it'll reach far... into next week when everyone forgets about it.</p><p>But seriously, think about it: south africa's strained ties with us face new test - war games with china, iran and russia - bbc. That's the world we're living in. Let that sink in.</p><p>And that's the story. Was it worth your time? Debatable. Will I do it again tomorrow? Absolutely. I got bills to pay.</p>
